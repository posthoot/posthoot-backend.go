                        5. Use simple, jargon-free language to explain technical changes like authentication, permissions, and API improvements
                        6. Include relevant emojis to make the notes engaging and scannable (üì® for email features, üë• for team features, üîê for auth features, etc.)
                        7. Call out any changes that affect subscription features, SMTP configuration, or domain management
                        8. Add helpful tips for getting the most out of new email automation and campaign features
                        9. Thank users for their feedback and contributions to the email marketing platform

                        12. Mention integration improvements with Google OAuth, Firebase, or payment systems when relevant
                        13. Highlight features that improve email deliverability, campaign performance, or team collaboration
                        14. Reference specific modules like Campaign Management, Template Management, Contact Management, Team Management, User Management, API Key Management, Automation, SMTP Configuration, Domain Management, or Webhook Management when applicable
                        15. End with what's coming next for the email marketing platform to build excitement
